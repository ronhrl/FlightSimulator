* You can see the joystick of the pilot, also you can see the throttle and rudder position in every second.
* You can see an updating Heading Deg compass.
* Visualing data of the plane and Stick:

* Visual Graphs: you can see 3 Graphs: Feature Graph, Correlated Feature Graph and Regeression Graph.
* The graphs are dynamically updating while flying. The left graph shows in X axis the number of current line from the CSV file, and in Y axis
* the value of the Feature which chosen in the list, in the right graph the Y axis is the value of the most correlated feature. In the list there are all the features from the CSV file and you can chose one of them to show.

* Upload Dll for Research your Flight and find some Errors. You can chose any Anomaly Detection Algorithn you want.
* for more info check the DLL info and the API.

## Setup
To install this project you need to install FlightGear 2020.3.6 or older.
in FlightGear -> settings -> Additional Settngs
```
--generic=socket,in,10,127.0.0.1,5400,tcp,playback_small
--fdm=null
--httpd=8080
```
Download playback_small.xml from the Model.




## Run
* run FG and press "Fly!" wait until running
* run this project
* Copy Playback_small - put the folder source of the file and the folder destention and press "copy XML" 
* example XML: 
* folder Source : C:\Downloads
* folder Destenation : C:\Program Files\FlightGear 2020.3.6\data\Protocol
* example CSV:
* folder Source : C:\Users\Omer\source\repos\FlightSimulator2\model
* make sure yout IP and port are set to 127.0.0.1:5400
* press "Connect to FG"
* ENJOY
